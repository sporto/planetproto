Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

- Define an object called `Robot`
- Define a method called `new` in `Robot`
- When `Robot.new` is called it should return a new object with the prototype set to `Robot` e.g.:

```js
var robby = Robot.new();
// Robot should be the prototype of robby
```

Boilerplate
-----------
